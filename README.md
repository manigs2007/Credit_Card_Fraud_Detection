# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection

As expected the dataset is highly imbalanced as anyy other dataset that is to be considered for Credit Card Fraud Detection. 
48 hours data was checked with over 99.8% of data belonging to Legitimate transactions.
Due to the such large shape of data, equal number of legitimate transactions were selected randomly to match with illegimate/fraud transactions to make it a balanced dataset.
Modelling was done to predict the fraud transactions.
